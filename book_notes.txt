=== INTRODUCTION === 
This novel describes the political and moral chaos enveloping a provincial town in 19th-century Russia. It examines the destructive effects of radical ideologies, nihilism, and atheism on Russian society and individuals. The story, inspired by the Sergey Nechayev affair, is built upon the intrigues of a secret revolutionary cell and the philosophical conflicts revolving around it.

=== CHARACTERS ===

    He uses nihilism as a tool for chaos and destruction. He represents Sergey Nechayev.
    
Stepan Trofimovich Verhovensky:
